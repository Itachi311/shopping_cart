# shopping_cart
Shopping cart using Flask and sqlite3

### Design and implement shopping cart for any marketplace

1. User should be able to List the Products
2. Add, Update and Remove multiple products in Shopping cart with different quantities
3. Shopping Cart should show individual and total price of the items in the cart
4. User should be able to add to cart without login and cart should be associated once user logs in.

### Implementation Details
1. Create and implement Rest Api for all the operations.
2. You can use any in memory database to store the product details. Easier to make it fully functional
3.  No need to build the UI, We are only looking for backend implementation
